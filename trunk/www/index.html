<b>2009-08-28, Balloon tip has switched to Maven, plus a brand-new special release:</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
Just like the entire java.net website, our little project has recently undergone some infrastructural changes as well:
<br />
<br /> Firstly, as you might already know, our CVS source code repository has now been traded in for <u>a shiny new SVN repository</u>.

<br />Secondly, the project has been adapted such that <u>we can now make use of Maven as our primary build tool</u>. Many thanks go to André Ricardo Barreto de Oliveira for helping out with this not-to-be-underestimated conversion process!
<br />Whilst Ant build files will no longer be supplied with any future Balloon tip releases, Maven makes it very easy to generate fully functional Ant build files; check the latest <a href="https://balloontip.dev.java.net/source/browse/*checkout*/balloontip/trunk/project/manual/index.htm">Balloon tip manual</a> for more info.)
<br />The switch to Maven has already resulted in some fine benefits: <u>The project now uses a regular version numbering scheme</u>, instead of using the release date to identify each new Balloon tip version, which was somewhat confusing. If you take a look at the <a href="https://balloontip.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Download page</a>, you'll see a new Balloon tip 1.0 release available. This 1.0 release contains the very same functionality as the previous release, but it is adapted for use with Maven.
<br />A more significant advantage of Maven is that, if your project already makes use of Maven, it will be even easier to make use of Balloon tip within your project, as <u>Balloon tip now is also available on <a href="https://maven2-repository.dev.java.net/">java.net's Maven 2 repository</a></u>! Just make sure your project can access the repository and then add a new dependency with artifactId <b>balloontip</b> and groupId <b>net.java.balloontip</b>; that's all there is to it.
</p>
<p>A last, but certainly not least, announcement is the availability of a new  special release! As you might have already experienced, Balloon tip is currently constrained to drawing its balloon tips within the boundaries of your application's window. This special release will <u>allow your balloon tips to break free and let them go beyond the window's boundaries</u>. Many thanks go out to David Straw for making this magic happen!
<br />Balloon tips can now be drawn outside a window because these will be drawn on a special seperate window that is completely transparent, which is a recent new Java feature. This implies you'll require Java 1.6 Update 12 (or higher). It should also be noted that this special release currently is only meant for experimentation, as it makes use of a Sun proprietary API, which you shouldn't rely upon. In other words, just have some fun with it, but don't use it in your stable builds just yet. If you'd like to see it in action, just open up balloontip-examples-1.0-transparent-window-support.jar , which comes supplied with the release. The source code for this example application can be found in the package net.java.balloontip.examples.transparency.

<p>
In case Java 1.5 is a little too newfangled for your project, your prayers have been heard:
</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://balloontip.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">Java 1.4.2-compatible version of balloontip</a> has been released</li>

<p>Many thanks to Nicholas Hutniak for creating this special release!</p>

<b>2008-11-14, Licensing mumbo jumbo:</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
Just a small change in order to be able to get the project into the Ubuntu repositories :
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added GNU Lesser Public License v3 preamble to all of the project's source files</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Stefan Handschuh for his efforts to make balloontip available on the Ubuntu repositories! As soon as it gets through, you can find our project there under the name "libballoontip-java".</p>
<p><strong>2009-01-05 EDIT:</strong> The source files' license preambles stated "General Public License" instead of "Lesser General Public License"... I have now re-uploaded the 2008-11-14 release with the proper preamble. Thanks to Maciej Jagiello for noticing this rather embarrassing mistake.</p>

<p>
Just a couple of minor changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Bug fix: Balloon tips can now be used within JApplets</li>
<li>Added a simple example application to show balloon tips now work in applets</li>
<li>The Ant build file now always compiles in Java 5</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Adewale Ajiboye for reporting the JApplet issue!</p>

<b>2008-09-24, Huge update:</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
It's been quite a while since we've released an update. To make up for that, we've just uploaded a big one! Check out all these new features/changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>BalloonTipStyle: Create new looks for balloon tips by extending the BalloonTipStyle-class</li>
<li>BalloonTipPositioner: Control the way a balloon tip positions itself by extending the BalloonTipPositioner-class</li>
<li>Added 3 new balloon tip styles: Minimal, Modern and Textured</li>
<li>CustomBalloonTip: allows you to attach a balloon tip to a certain offset rectangle within a JComponent</li>
<li>TablecellBalloonTip: allows you to attach a balloon tip to a JTable cell</li>
<li>TimingUtils: Automatically close a balloon tip after a certain time</li>
<li>ToolTipUtils: Turn a balloon tip into a tooltip</li>
<li>Balloon tips will now try their best to stay visible; if a balloon tip collides with the window's border, it will either shift or flip itself</li>
<li>Balloon tips now have the option to close or hide themselves by clicking anywhere on the balloon tip</li>
<li>More constructors, ranging from easy-to-use to full-fledged</li>
<li>The new CompleteExample application shows off most of the project's features</li>
<li>More example applications were added</li>
<li>The project now has a user manual</li>
<li>The project now has an Ant build file</li>
<li>Bug fixes: The balloon tip will no longer throw a NullPointerException if you try to create it before calling pack() on the top level container</li>
</ul>

<p>If you'd like to get started quickly, just <a href="https://balloontip.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">download the latest release</a> and have a look at the <code>README.txt</code> file.</p>

<p>One last thing, not quite a feature though: This project now has another owner, which is me (nferno; you can call me Tim though :) ). Bernhard still is the main project owner, but as he won't have that much time for the project, 
	I have come to the rescue! *plays superman theme* Does this imply any changes for you? Well, yes: If you have any questions or suggestions, please send them to me, at <a href="mailto:nferno@dev.java.net">nferno@dev.java.net</a>.</p>

<b>2007-12-30, Big update after long time:</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
The new version includes the following main features (besides some bug fixes):
<ul>
<li>The balloon tip can now be displayed above or below on either side of the attached component</li>
<li>The location of the triangle tip can be set manually to the center and all "corners" of the attached component (useful for icons)</li>
<li>The border width of the close button can be set</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The API has changed a little bit - sorry for that. For explanation look <a href="#explanation">here</a> ("How to use BalloonTip").</p>
<p>A bigger change is the move to Java 5. It has been out now for a while, so I don't think it will be a big problem. If you are locked down to an older version, you can still make it work for you by replacing the enumerations in the source code with constants.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy: The release package now contains an executable JAR. Double-click on the JAR to launch the example application:</p>

<b>2007-05-15, Rather big update:</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
It's about time that the project receives an update - and here it is. This new version includes the following features:
<ul>
<li>One new flavor: Rounded balloon tips</li>
<li>Close buttons</li>
<li>Revised example application</li>
<li>Some other but minor improvements like expanded customizability</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The API has been changed rather drastically, look <a href="#explanation">here</a> for explanation ("How to use BalloonTip").</p>
<p>I would like to thank Mina R. Waheeb who wrote me an email with her modification for rounded balloon tips. I used it as a foundation for my implementation. Thanks, Mina!</p>

I recently received an email from Adhari Huda aka Harry who uses BalloonTip. He noticed and fixed two bugs:
<ul>
<li>Support for JInternalFrame was missing</li>
<li>Location of BalloonTip component was miscalculated in more complex layouts</li>
</ul>
The fixes are in the code base now and are wrapped up in a new release. Thank you very much, Harry!
