<b>2008-11-14, Licensing mumbo jumbo:</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
Just a small change in order to be able to get the project into the Ubuntu repositories :
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added GNU Lesser Public License v3 preamble to all of the project's source files</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to Stefan Handschuh for his efforts to make balloontip available on the Ubuntu repositories! As soon as it gets through, you can find our project there under the name "libballoontip-java".</p>
<p><strong>2009-01-05 EDIT:</strong> The source files' license preambles stated "General Public License" instead of "Lesser General Public License"... I have now re-uploaded the 2008-11-14 release with the proper preamble. Thanks to Maciej Jagiello for noticing this rather embarrassing mistake.</p>

<b>2008-09-24, Huge update:</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
It's been quite a while since we've released an update. To make up for that, we've just uploaded a big one! Check out all these new features/changes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>BalloonTipStyle: Create new looks for balloon tips by extending the BalloonTipStyle-class</li>
<li>BalloonTipPositioner: Control the way a balloon tip positions itself by extending the BalloonTipPositioner-class</li>
<li>Added 3 new balloon tip styles: Minimal, Modern and Textured</li>
<li>CustomBalloonTip: allows you to attach a balloon tip to a certain offset rectangle within a JComponent</li>
<li>TablecellBalloonTip: allows you to attach a balloon tip to a JTable cell</li>
<li>TimingUtils: Automatically close a balloon tip after a certain time</li>
<li>ToolTipUtils: Turn a balloon tip into a tooltip</li>
<li>Balloon tips will now try their best to stay visible; if a balloon tip collides with the window's border, it will either shift or flip itself</li>
<li>Balloon tips now have the option to close or hide themselves by clicking anywhere on the balloon tip</li>
<li>More constructors, ranging from easy-to-use to full-fledged</li>
<li>The new CompleteExample application shows off most of the project's features</li>
<li>More example applications were added</li>
<li>The project now has a user manual</li>
<li>The project now has an Ant build file</li>
<li>Bug fixes: The balloon tip will no longer throw a NullPointerException if you try to create it before calling pack() on the top level container</li>
</ul>

<p>If you'd like to get started quickly, just <a href="https://balloontip.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">download the latest release</a> and have a look at the <code>README.txt</code> file.</p>

<p>One last thing, not quite a feature though: This project now has another owner, which is me (nferno; you can call me Tim though :) ). Bernhard still is the main project owner, but as he won't have that much time for the project, 
	I have come to the rescue! *plays superman theme* Does this imply any changes for you? Well, yes: If you have any questions or suggestions, please send them to me, at <a href="mailto:nferno@dev.java.net">nferno@dev.java.net</a>.</p>

<b>2007-12-30, Big update after long time:</b>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<p>
The new version includes the following main features (besides some bug fixes):
<ul>
<li>The balloon tip can now be displayed above or below on either side of the attached component</li>
<li>The location of the triangle tip can be set manually to the center and all "corners" of the attached component (useful for icons)</li>
<li>The border width of the close button can be set</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The API has changed a little bit - sorry for that. For explanation look <a href="#explanation">here</a> ("How to use BalloonTip").</p>
<p>A bigger change is the move to Java 5. It has been out now for a while, so I don't think it will be a big problem. If you are locked down to an older version, you can still make it work for you by replacing the enumerations in the source code with constants.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy: The release package now contains an executable JAR. Double-click on the JAR to launch the example application:</p>

<p>
It's about time that the project receives an update - and here it is. This new version includes the following features:
<ul>
<li>One new flavor: Rounded balloon tips</li>
<li>Close buttons</li>
<li>Revised example application</li>
<li>Some other but minor improvements like expanded customizability</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The API has been changed rather drastically, look <a href="#explanation">here</a> for explanation ("How to use BalloonTip").</p>
<p>I would like to thank Mina R. Waheeb who wrote me an email with her modification for rounded balloon tips. I used it as a foundation for my implementation. Thanks, Mina!</p>

I recently received an email from Adhari Huda aka Harry who uses BalloonTip. He noticed and fixed two bugs:
<ul>
<li>Support for JInternalFrame was missing</li>
<li>Location of BalloonTip component was miscalculated in more complex layouts</li>
</ul>
The fixes are in the code base now and are wrapped up in a new release. Thank you very much, Harry!
